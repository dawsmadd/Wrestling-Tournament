# Wrestling-Tournament

The purpose of this project is to create 8 high school wrestling teams. The size of the team is assigned by a normal distribution of the common size of a high school wrestling team. The wrestlers are then assigned a weight class based on a normal distribution of normnal high school kid's weights. These wrestlers are then assigned an ability score, which tells how good the wrestler will wrestle. After the teams are assigned, brackets are created for each weight class and the tournament begins in round robin style. 

After wrestlers are matched they enter a bout and their ability scores compared to eachtother. based on the difference, an amount of points are assigned to the winning wrestler and team, and the rest of the bouts continue. After the first weight class is complete, it moves onto the next weight class and so on.

After the completion of all weight classes, the results of each match are fed into a text file in the code and the screen outputs the top 3 (or smaller amount if a weight class has a low amount of wrestlers) wrestlers in each bracket. The screen then shows the top 3 teams, whose wrestlers had scored the most combined.

This code will begin and terminate automatically after running it.
